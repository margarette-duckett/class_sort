Class_sort

Project Description 
This project is designed to assist elementary school teachers with the baseline sorting of students into classes.
The sorting algorithm accounts for special codes such as SPED (Special Education), ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages), and GATES (Gifted and Talented Education Services), while maintaining balanced class distributions.
By automating the initial sorting process, this tool significantly reduces the time and effort teachers need to manually organize students into equitable classes.
